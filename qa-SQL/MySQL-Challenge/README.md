# MySQL-Challenge

This repo contains the three databases with data that you will need to add to your MySQL Workbench (Sakila, World and Movielens).

There is also a file that contains 50 questions, 25 for Sakila, 20 for World and 5 for Movielens.
These are of different difficulties, and not in a particular order so if you get stuck on one, move onto the next and come back to the harder ones after.

To import these into MySQL workbench, clone and pull the repository, and then open the files in MySQL workbench. Make sure for Sakila and World that you run the schema's before the data files.
